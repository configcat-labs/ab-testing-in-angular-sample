This sample app accompanies the blog post above and demonstrates how to A/B test an angular application using [ConfigCat feature flags](https://configcat.com/featureflags) and [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/). The goal of the experiment is determine whether changing the color of the Pro plan badge color from yellow to green will generate more clicks.
